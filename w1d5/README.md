### [Knight's Travails](https://github.com/appacademy/ruby-curriculum/blob/master/projects/w1d5-knights-travails.md)

In this problem we want to write a class that will find a path for a
Chess Knight from a starting position to an end position.  Both the
starting and ending position should be on a standard 8x8 chess board.

**NB**: this problem is a lot like word chains!
